## Overview

Bangladesh, being an agricultural country, heavily relies on crops like Rice, Corn/Maize, Potato, Wheat, and more. This project focuses on the classification of diseases affecting major crops in Bangladesh. The dataset used for training and evaluation is curated from the PlantVillage dataset, Rice Disease Dataset, and Wheat Disease Dataset.

## Classes

The dataset consists of 15 classes, each representing a different crop disease. Here is a list of the classes:

1. Corn___Common_Rust
2. Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot
3. Corn___Healthy
4. Corn___Leaf_Blight
5. Invalid
6. Potato___Early_Blight
7. Potato___Healthy
8. Potato___Late_Blight
9. Rice___Brown_Spot
10. Rice___Healthy
11. Rice___Hispa
12. Rice___Leaf_Blast
13. Wheat___Brown_Rust
14. Wheat___Healthy
15. Wheat___Yellow_Rust
